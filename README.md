# wiki-ipsum

> Get random text generated from wikipedia articles. More interesting filler than your average lorem ipsum.

For longer Ipsums, many requests must be made to wikipedia which could slow down your application

```

#### Example Usage:

```js
const wikiIpsum = require("wiki-ipsum");

wikiIpsum().then(text => {
	console.log(text);
